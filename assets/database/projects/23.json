The TCS3200 color sensor is a widely used device for color sensing due to its simplicity, accuracy, and ease of integration. To harness the full potential of this sensor, this library was developed, a powerful and user-friendly API that allows Arduino developers to interface with the TCS3200 sensor effortlessly.</p><p>The TCS3200 color sensor is a programmable device that can detect and measure the intensity of light across different color channels. It comes equipped with an array of photodiodes, each covered by a specific color filter: red, green, blue, and clear. The clear photodiode captures ambient light and is used to calculate the overall intensity.</p><br/><center><a class=\"btn-reactive-a\" href=\"https://github.com/nthnn/TCS3200\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"btn-reactive btn-lg\"><div class=\"i-wrapper\"><i class=\"lni lni-github no-rotate\"></i></div><span class=\"lead\">Get on GitHub</span></button></a></center><br class=\"mobile-break\"/></div><div class=\"col-lg-5\"><a href=\"./assets/images/projects/project_23_01.png\"><img src=\"./assets/images/projects/project_23_01.png\" width=\"100%\" /></a></div></div>"
