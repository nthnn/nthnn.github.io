It is designed for resource-constrained environments but can be used with non-Arduino platform projects, offering a streamlined solution for tasks that require neural network capabilities.</p></div><div class=\"col-lg-6\"><a href=\"./assets/images/projects/project_24.png\"><img src=\"./assets/images/projects/project_24.png\" width=\"100%\" /><br/><br/><center><a class=\"btn-reactive-a\" href=\"https://github.com/nthnn/Diwa\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"btn-reactive btn-lg\"><div class=\"i-wrapper\"><i class=\"lni lni-github no-rotate\"></i></div><span class=\"lead\">Get on GitHub</span></button></a></center><br class=\"mobile-break\"/></a></div>"
